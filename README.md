This is an analysis of which teams go to the playoffs and which one get to win the World Series. I am using two types of mathematical models to conduct my analysis. They are Logistic Regression and 
Decision Trees. From the ipynb files, I have conducted an analysis and so far Logistic Regression seems to be the most accurate. 

## Datasets 
The datasets I have acquired were from the site https://www.baseball-reference.com/

## Overview 
I have conducted Logistic Regression for batting and for fielding and pitching, I have used Decision Tree models. There were the models I have chosen that best predicted the players going to the 
playoffs accurately in their respective positions. 

## Conclusion 
Mathematically, the teams with the best Batting Average, Slugging Percentage, Weighted On-Base Average, and Run Differential tend to have a better chance to go to the playoffs. 

With pitching, the teams that acquired the best ERA, Career Saves, Shutouts, and the least amount of runs per game will have a highest chance of going to the playoffs. 

The teams that acquired the highest statistics in The National League and the American League will be the teams that are likely to 
go to the World Series.
