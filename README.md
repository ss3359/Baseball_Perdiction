# Baseball_Perdiction

This is an analysis of which teams go to the playoffs and which one get to win the World Series. I am using two types of mathematical models to conduct my analysis. They are Logistic Regression and 
Gaussian Naive Bayes. From the ipynb files, I have conducted an analysis and so far Logistic Regression seems to be the most accurate. 

## Datasets 
The datasets I have acquired were from the site https://www.baseball-reference.com/
